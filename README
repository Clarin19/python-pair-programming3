This purpose of this submission was to frame a business question, analyse location based data and perform geospatial analysis

Business Context:

AirBnB is a leading firm in hospitality and following their mission, they want to place their focus on establishing positive exchanges between guests and hosts in Edinburgh, one of the most populous cities in Scotland, housing the prestigious University of Edinburgh.

They seek assistance from the University's finest data analysts to analyse currently offered listings, make necessary recommendations and suggest changes to improve their services in this city of medieval history. Most of the current listings cover the city centre area; however, there is still a business opportunity gap in which data-driven analysis could support its business growth plan.

This study will help define strategic decision on Airbnb property listing expansion, focusing on the below objectives:

Distribution of listings
Potential for expansion
Feature selection for price impact
Provision of facilities
